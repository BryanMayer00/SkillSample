# SkillSample
Sample code from a larger Skill project.

This particular piece of code accomplishes two major goals with a few sub goals.

The first goal is to create a function that will check the selected object's type from a list, then move the object to the coordinates provided. 

The second goal is to provide a form that the user can enter coordinates into with which the object can be moved.
